    <h1> THIS IS DAY TWO </h1>

     <p>Well trying to  complete an entire html course in one day isn't as easy as I expected,
       <dt><em>well atleast no for a beginner. </em></dt>
    
 </P>
      <h4>So anyway we got some pictures today from the kickoff program.</h4> 
      <img src="pic1.JPG" alt="group pictures" height="200px" width="300px">
     <img src="pic3.JPG" alt="group pictures" height="200px" width="300px">
<P>That's pretty much the only highlight for today and I also
     learnt some new tags;<em>emphasis,</em> <strong>strong</strong> and the discriptive term element.
     <dt>See you tomorrowðŸ™Œ</dt></P>
